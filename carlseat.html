	<div class="panel-body panel_text">
		Among Carleton College students, there have been concerns raised about the structure and pricing of the dining halls. In our experience, the meals offered tend to leave many students wondering about dietary restriction labeling and feeling unsatisfied with the menus offered each day. Our goal is to prototype a food rating app that can be implemented to allow Carleton students to easily capture images/descriptions of their food, rate dishes, and share this information with their peers. We want to help Carls get a better sense of what foods are available to them, how those foods meet or don’t meet their dietary needs, and what comparable alternatives could look like so they can get the most out of their dining experience while at Carleton.
	<br>
	<br>
	After conducting focus group sessions and semi-structured interviews with potential users for our CarlsEat app, these are some of our key takeaways and how our prototype addresses them:
		<ul>
			<li>Students feel like the app would need a sizable portion of Carleton’s campus using it in order for students to truly get a good sense of what dishes their peers are liking that day.</li>
			<li>The design of our prototype incorporates a feed page that operates very similarly to a social media app.</li>
			<li>Students are familiar with social media, know how to like, comment, and save posts, and feel like user captions and a comment section where students can discuss the post’s dish is the best way to drive engagement (allowing as many students as possible to better understand the dietary restrictions and quality of dining hall meals so they can pick which dining hall to attend for a given meal).</li>
			<li>In addition, students expressed frustrations with a lack of variety and unfamiliarity with the structure and pricing of their meal plans as well as how to change meal plans.</li>
			<li>The ability to save posts allows users who are off-board to participate in the app and also provides for the inclusion of cooking recipes or dishes from local restaurants, which helps encourage students to explore (and learn more about) their meal plan options while simultaneously providing variety for students outside of the dining hall.</li>
		</ul>

	<img src="images/Figma Prototype 1 Image.png" alt="Image of our CarlsEat stage 1 app prototype. The app prototype features four pages. The first page is a straightforward login page. The second page resembles a social media feed with images posted that users can like, save, or comment on. The third page is for users to post images themselves, with an option to add a caption as well as dietary tags for the dish they are posting. Finally, the fourth page is a profile settings page that allows users to view previously saved dishes, change their profile picture or password, and log out. It also contains a brief message about CarlsEat and our goals.">

<div class="panel-body panel_text">
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">Requirement Statements and Descriptions With Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Requirement Statement 1</b>: Users shall be able to write and post detailed reviews for campus dining hall meals, provide feedback about the food, and their overall experience.</li>
			<li><b>Rationale</b>: The review system allows for students to share personal experiences, which will enhance the decision making process for others and provide feedback for the college.</li>
			<li><b>Requirement Statement 2</b>: Users shall be able to filter and/or tag dining hall meal options and reviews based on food allergies and dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, halal, gluten-free, nut, dairy, soy) to accommodate personal needs.</li>
			<li><b>Rationale</b>: This is critical for ensuring student health and safety, allowing users to see the breadth of options available to them and it also allows users to search for food they might be in the mood for.</li>
			<li><b>Requirement Statement 3</b>: Users shall be able to make reviews in three optional formats; images, predetermined slider or number system, or text input.</li>
			<li><b>Rationale</b>: Necessary to provide a holistic approach to ratings, as people rely on various factors when making meal decisions and some users might prefer reading a breakdown of a dish over a rating system and many users emphasized the importance of images (as the current “CarlsApp” doesn’t show images with menus).</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">How our Prototype Addresses the Requirements</h4>
		<ul>	
			<li>Our prototype addresses the first requirement with the “Post” page, which allows users to create a post (that will be displayed on everyone’s feed once posted) that can feature an image, written description of the food and their opinion of it, labels for dietary restrictions, and a 1-10 slider of how much they liked the dish. This provides users with options for reviewing dining hall meals and providing feedback about the food as well as their experience in as much detail as the user would like.</li>
			<li>Our prototype addresses the second requirement with the filter button on the feed page, which brings users to a screen where they can select as many dietary options as they would like. Once the user taps the apply button, they are returned to the feed with only posted dishes/reviews with the dietary tags corresponding to the ones they selected now visible.</li>
			<li>Our prototype addresses the third requirement with the “Post” page, which (as mentioned above) speaks to users’ desires for diverse ways to express and engage with opinions/information by allowing users to share an image, a written description, and/or a 1-10 slider rating of how much they liked the dish depending on what their preferences are.</li>
		</ul>

	<img src="images/Mid_Fid_Proto.png" alt="Image of our CarlsEat stage 2 (Mid-Fidelity) app prototype. The app prototype is mostly similar to the previous prototype with added interaction flows (described below) and a new page that allows the user to select dietary restrictions to filter posts on their feed or to apply dietary tags to a post when they are in the process of making a post. There is also an added slider for users to rate their dish 1-10 when they post.">
