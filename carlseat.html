	<div class="panel-body panel_text">
		Among Carleton College students, there have been concerns raised about the structure and pricing of the dining halls. In our experience, the meals offered tend to leave many students wondering about dietary restriction labeling and feeling unsatisfied with the menus offered each day. Our goal is to prototype a food rating app that can be implemented to allow Carleton students to easily capture images/descriptions of their food, rate dishes, and share this information with their peers. We want to help Carls get a better sense of what foods are available to them, how those foods meet or don’t meet their dietary needs, and what comparable alternatives could look like so they can get the most out of their dining experience while at Carleton.
	<br>
	<br>
	After conducting focus group sessions and semi-structured interviews with potential users for our CarlsEat app, these are some of our key takeaways and how our prototype addresses them:
		<ul>
			<li>Students feel like the app would need a sizable portion of Carleton’s campus using it in order for students to truly get a good sense of what dishes their peers are liking that day.</li>
			<li>The design of our prototype incorporates a feed page that operates very similarly to a social media app.</li>
			<li>Students are familiar with social media, know how to like, comment, and save posts, and feel like user captions and a comment section where students can discuss the post’s dish is the best way to drive engagement (allowing as many students as possible to better understand the dietary restrictions and quality of dining hall meals so they can pick which dining hall to attend for a given meal).</li>
			<li>In addition, students expressed frustrations with a lack of variety and unfamiliarity with the structure and pricing of their meal plans as well as how to change meal plans.</li>
			<li>The ability to save posts allows users who are off-board to participate in the app and also provides for the inclusion of cooking recipes or dishes from local restaurants, which helps encourage students to explore (and learn more about) their meal plan options while simultaneously providing variety for students outside of the dining hall.</li>
		</ul>

<div>
	<img src="images/Figma Prototype 1 Image.png" alt="Image of our CarlsEat stage 1 app prototype. The app prototype features four pages. The first page is a straightforward login page. The second page resembles a social media feed with images posted that users can like, save, or comment on. The third page is for users to post images themselves, with an option to add a caption as well as dietary tags for the dish they are posting. Finally, the fourth page is a profile settings page that allows users to view previously saved dishes, change their profile picture or password, and log out. It also contains a brief message about CarlsEat and our goals." class = "center">

<div class="panel-body panel_text">
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">Requirement Statements and Descriptions With Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Requirement Statement 1</b>: Users shall be able to write and post detailed reviews for campus dining hall meals, provide feedback about the food, and their overall experience.</li>
			<li><b>Rationale</b>: The review system allows for students to share personal experiences, which will enhance the decision making process for others and provide feedback for the college.</li>
			<li><b>Requirement Statement 2</b>: Users shall be able to filter and/or tag dining hall meal options and reviews based on food allergies and dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, halal, gluten-free, nut, dairy, soy) to accommodate personal needs.</li>
			<li><b>Rationale</b>: This is critical for ensuring student health and safety, allowing users to see the breadth of options available to them and it also allows users to search for food they might be in the mood for.</li>
			<li><b>Requirement Statement 3</b>: Users shall be able to make reviews in three optional formats; images, predetermined slider or number system, or text input.</li>
			<li><b>Rationale</b>: Necessary to provide a holistic approach to ratings, as people rely on various factors when making meal decisions and some users might prefer reading a breakdown of a dish over a rating system and many users emphasized the importance of images (as the current “CarlsApp” doesn’t show images with menus).</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">How our Prototype Addresses the Requirements</h4>
		<ul>	
			<li>Our prototype addresses the first requirement with the “Post” page, which allows users to create a post (that will be displayed on everyone’s feed once posted) that can feature an image, written description of the food and their opinion of it, labels for dietary restrictions, and a 1-10 slider of how much they liked the dish. This provides users with options for reviewing dining hall meals and providing feedback about the food as well as their experience in as much detail as the user would like.</li>
			<li>Our prototype addresses the second requirement with the filter button on the feed page, which brings users to a screen where they can select as many dietary options as they would like. Once the user taps the apply button, they are returned to the feed with only posted dishes/reviews with the dietary tags corresponding to the ones they selected now visible.</li>
			<li>Our prototype addresses the third requirement with the “Post” page, which (as mentioned above) speaks to users’ desires for diverse ways to express and engage with opinions/information by allowing users to share an image, a written description, and/or a 1-10 slider rating of how much they liked the dish depending on what their preferences are.</li>
		</ul>

<div class="panel-body panel_text">
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">Team UX Research Process</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Our team prepared protocols for semi-structured interviews as well as focus groups that presented our interviewees with questions aimed at discovering their thought processes, likes and dislikes, and struggles when picking a meal, deciding which dining hall to go to, discussing/sharing meals with friends, interacting with and accomplishing tasks in apps, etc.</li>
			<li>Ekow conducted two semi-structured interviews and Chloe, Zubeyda, and I each conducted focus groups of two students with each of us collecting information from students of different grades and meal plans so we could get a sense of differing perspectives among the student populace.</li>
			<li>One sentiment that almost all of the students (across distinct general feelings about the dining halls) echoed was that the app would be useful to them in planning their meals (particularly if we could get a large portion of campus engaged on the app regularly).</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">Team Analysis Process</h4>
		<ul>	
			<li>After our interviews, we each axially coded another teammate’s transcript (breaking the transcripts into phenomena, conditions, actions, and consequences)</li>
			<li>Next, the four of us met up and created an affinity diagram, chunking our axial codes (the specific phenomena, conditions, etc. that appeared in our transcript) into groups and seeing what was most prevalent.</li>
			<li>To check out what we discovered, you can access our affinity diagram with the link below.</li>
			<li><a href = "https://www.figma.com/board/MmStn5D4upkNxeDRG5cZjq/Affinity-Diagramming?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=ila6BSs4AMbtacyF-0">Affinity Diagram Hyperlink</a></li>
			<li>After our affinity diagram, we developed an axial codebook of the themes we saw across interviews, which we then used to go back and code the transcripts from every interview we had conducted (two team members coded each transcript and came to a consensus through discussion on their readings of the transcript).</li>
			<li>Finally, our team generated requirement statements (three of which you can see above) for our app prototype derived from our findings.</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">Descriptions of Interaction Flows</h4>
		<ul>	
			<li>Clicking the login button redirects the user to the feed.</li>
			<li>Clicking the filter button on the feed page redirects the user to the dietary restrictions page, where they can select from a number of dietary tags before clicking the apply button to be returned to a feed that now only features meals matching the selected tags. There is also a back button on the filter page to return to the feed without selecting any tags.</li>
			<li>From the feed page, the user can click the profile picture button to be redirected to the profile settings page, where there is a back button to return to the feed.</li>
			<li>From either the feed or settings page, the user can click the plus button in the top right corner to be redirected to the post page, where they can design a post by uploading an image, typing a caption, and dragging a slider to rate their dish 1 through 10. The post page also features a button the user can click to be redirected to the dietary tag page but here, selecting dietary restrictions adds them as tags to the post the user is making (so when the user hits the back button or the apply button, the user returns to the post they are creating).</li>
		</ul>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="panel-body panel_text">
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">UX Evaluation</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>For my prototype’s UX evaluation, I conducted a focus group with two Carleton College students (one junior on the 15-meal plan and one freshman on the 20-meal plan).</li>
			<li>Generally speaking, the users found my prototype to be easy to navigate due to its relatively clear and simple buttons.</li>
			<li>The informal metrics I collected involved timing users and measuring how many questions and misclicks they faced while executing simple tasks (saving posts, creating posts, etc.) and all of our findings corroborated the idea that the app felt “pretty self explanatory,” as one user put it.</li>
			<li>The grey boxes around buttons allowed the users to easily understand what is clickable and what is plain text. </li>
			<li>The users felt that most other college students who are familiar with social media would find the app’s features to be pretty intuitive.</li>
			<li>In addition, they appreciated the ability to share information about a dish in different ways (1-10 rating, image, and/or written description).</li>
			<li>Still, both users identified a menu page as a valuable addition, expressing concerns that early eaters might influence later eaters by filling their feed with posts that could exclude dishes with dietary restrictions.</li>
			<li>Their solution was to offer a page that allows users to view the menu currently offered in either of the two dining halls (Burton and LDC).</li>
			<li>Finally, the two users echoed the popular sentiments from our requirements elicitation interviews that the app would be most useful if enough of the campus was engaged and posting regularly so there would be enough people and posts to get a sense for how the campus feels about a given dish.</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h4 style = "text-align: center;">Prototype Improvements Based on UX Evaluation</h4>
		<ul>	
			<li>The most critical improvement I made moving from my mid-fidelity prototype to my final prototype was adding the menu page. </li>
			<li>While the users generally appreciated the social media style feed page, they worried that it allows for users to fail to grasp the breadth of the menu offered to them as well as to struggle to find posts about dishes that meet their dietary needs.</li>
			<li>The new menu page, which can be easily navigated to through a button labeled “Menu”, allows users to select a dining hall and then view the full menu for that meal.</li>
			<li>In addition, each dish is a button that redirects users to a feed of all the posts about that specific dish when clicked so they can choose dishes they think they might like or that might meet their needs and then get a sense of how people are liking that dish.</li>
			<li>Users can also use the filter button on the menu page in the same manner as it is used on the feed page, allowing for the selection of dietary preferences. After selecting their preferences and clicking the “apply” button, users are redirected to the menu but with only dishes that match their selected preferences appearing.</li>
			<li>Apart from the menu page, the final prototype includes some visual improvements (a cute, cartoonish logo and a maize and blue color scheme that matches the school’s colors) aimed at making the app more engaging for students on campus as the users emphasized the importance of getting a lot of users on the app for it to function well.</li>
		</ul>

		<img src="images/Final Prototype Images.png" alt="Image of our CarlsEat stage 3 (High-Fidelity) app prototype. The app prototype is mostly similar to the mid-fidelity prototype with the main improvements being the addition of the menu page and some visual alterations (described above)" class = "center">
